# App look, condensed

Source: `DESIGN.md` (the full record), `CLAUDE.md` "UI conventions", and the live tokens in `ui/app.css`. Read the full `DESIGN.md` before adding a component.

## Colour tokens (dark theme)

| Role | Token | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| The window, showing between panels | `window` | `#101215` |
| Wells: fields, `kbd`, segmented controls, snippets | `deep` | `#15181c` |
| Content under the tabs, the active tab | `bg` | `#1c2025` |
| Sidebar, tab strip, file panel, status bar, every floating layer | `panel` | `#22262c` |
| Button faces, menu-item hover, current Settings page | `raised` | `#2b3037` |
| Button under the pointer | `hover` | `#353b44` |
| Every 1px border | `line` | `#353b43` |
| Primary text | `fg` | `#e3e6ea` |
| Secondary text, labels, idle tabs and tools | `weak` | `#959da8` |
| The one accent (user-changeable; never hard-code) | `gold` | `#d8a84e` |
| Text on a gold fill | `gold-ink` | `#1d1608` |
| Picked rows, search hits, tags, drop zones | `gold-soft` | `rgba(216, 168, 78, 0.16)` |
| Connected | `ok` | `#4fc08d` |
| Waiting, slow, nearly full | `warn` | `#e0b04a` |
| Disconnected, failures, danger | `error` (text on it: `error-ink` `#200a0a`) | `#ec6a6a` |

Kind hues (`--k-*`), read through a local `--kind`:

| Kind | Name | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| SSH (also forward tunnels `--fwd`) | Cobalt | `#5c8df0` |
| Local shell (also reverse tunnels `--back`) | Teal | `#33b8a6` |
| Serial | Chartreuse | `#b5c14a` |
| RDP | Violet | `#9c70e6` |
| Website | Rose | `#dd6b9c` |
| Telnet | Copper | `#d98a4a` |
| WinRM | Cyan | `#4aa8d9` |
| VNC | Orchid | `#c46fd1` |
| BMC console | Bare Titanium | `#8fa3b8` |
| AI agent | Ember (same value as `error`) | `#ec6a6a` |

- Accent presets are metals: Platinum `#c3ccd8`, Bronze `#a99a78`, Rose gold `#e2a395`, each with a light-theme value (`ACCENTS` in `ui/lib/api.ts`); presets stay off the kind hues and the error red.
- User marks (`COLORS` in `api.ts`: nine swatches, no gold) tint names (`.tinted`) and tab connector lines, never a session's icon.
- The light theme (`:root[data-theme="light"]`) redefines every token with the same roles; values also in `.impeccable/design.json` (`colorMeta.*.light`).

## Type

| Role | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Display | 700, `clamp(13px, 1.9vw, 21px)`, Recursive mono | the start screen's ASCII banner only, with the spectrum gradient (nowhere else) |
| Headline | 400, `--t-xl` 16.5px, line height φ | the lead sentence under the banner |
| Title | 600, `--t-l` 14.5px | dialog and page titles; section heads are 600 at body size |
| Body | 400, `--t` 13px, 1.4 | buttons, fields, rows, menus |
| Prose | 400, 13px, line height φ (21px), 62–70ch | paragraphs and text areas |
| Label | 400, `--t-s` 11.5px | status bar, counts (`tabular-nums`), tags, `kbd`, hints |
| Mono | 0.92em, Recursive `'MONO' 1, 'CASL' 0` | `code`, `kbd`, `pre`; always left to right |
| `--t-xxl` 18.5px | | only the RDP connect/close status and the sign-in code |

Interface face: Segoe UI Variable Text, Segoe UI, system-ui, -apple-system, Ubuntu. The terminal's own font is the user's setting.

## Layout and sizes

- The window is padded by `--gap` (5px) and holds up to three floating panels: the session rack (resizable, collapses to a 38px rail), the centre (34px tab strip over the panes) and the file panel (340px).
- Split panes are each their own panel (5px corners, hairline) with the window's dark between them; pane sizers are 6px hit areas, gold-tinted on hover.
- Forms: a two-column grid, labels in `weak` (120 to 233px, ending in `…` past that), gaps `8px 13px`.
- No breakpoints: things shrink, ellipsize and scroll. Logical properties for right to left.
- The start screen sits on the golden section, a column at most 610px wide.

## Named rules

| Rule | Says |
|---|---|
| One Accent | gold says "you are here" or "you picked this"; exceptions: the primary button's fill and folder tags |
| Cable Colour | a kind hue identifies a kind of connection and nothing else; state is `ok` / `warn` / `error` |
| See-Through Chrome | chrome is `rgba(var(--…-rgb), var(--chrome-alpha))`, never an opaque hex |
| Five Sizes | every `font-size` is a type token, `inherit`, an `em` or a `clamp()` (the test fails on raw px) |
| Golden Line | prose and text areas use `line-height: var(--phi)`; dense UI text stays 1.4 |
| Fibonacci | padding, margin, gap, inset and radius are Fibonacci pixels (the test fails on 4, 6, 10, 12, 16) |
| Derived Value | a value worked out from others is a `calc(…)` (`calc(8px + 16px + 5px)`, `calc(var(--r-menu) - 3px)`) |
| Float-Only Shadow | only layers that float over the work and go away cast a shadow, from the three tokens |
| Nested Curve | an inner radius is the outer one less the room between them, as `calc()` |

## Shadows and motion

| Token | Value | For |
|---|---|---|
| `--shadow-float` | `0 4px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)` | find and reconnect bars, the detached-window hint |
| `--shadow-menu` | `0 6px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.36)` | context menus, dropdowns, toasts, tooltips |
| `--shadow-dialog` | `0 8px 28px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)` | dialogs and the command palette |
| scrim | `rgba(8, 10, 12, 0.4)` behind a dialog, `0.32` behind the palette | |

- Arrival: `float-in` (a fade from 5px short, 0.16s, `--ease-out`); menus open instantly.
- Toasts: 2.4s, or 8s with an action (Undo, Reopen); leave in 0.1s.
- The focus ring glides between panes over 0.2s (Static in Settings › Appearance makes it jump).
- Settings search lights the setting (`.lit`), then fades it over 2.6s (`.found`).

## Components to know by name

- **Buttons**: 26px, `3px 8px`, 3px corners; default `raised`; primary gold with `gold-ink`; danger red with `error-ink` (`button.primary.danger`); on/selected gold wash with gold text and a 55% gold border; flat icon-only tool buttons (`3px 5px`) in `weak` with a tooltip; `button.link` gold, `.quiet` a dotted-underline sentence; focus a 1px gold outline inside the edge.
- **Fields**: `deep` wells, hairline, 26px, `3px 8px`; focus turns the border gold, no glow; placeholders are examples in `weak`; native checks, radios, ranges tinted with `accent-color: var(--gold)`.
- **Menus**: panel at 98%, hairline, 5px corners, 3px padding, at least 190px; 26px items; `.sep` groups; `.danger` last, red on a 14% red wash when pointed at.
- **Tab strip**: 34px; flat tabs split by hairlines; the active tab takes `bg` and drops its bottom line; a 2px connector on top in the tab's mark or kind hue (hidden idle, 50% when visible in a split, full when active); a 2px gold insertion bar while dragging.
- **Session rack**: 21px rows, carets rotating 0.12s, a hairline guide per level, a 7px green dot on an open session's icon (hollow once the connection is gone).
- **Status bar**: 21px, label size, `user@host` first, the folder with its tags as gold chips (`Production/Web · prod`), a state dot, the gold broadcast marker last.
- **Dialogs**: panel at 98%, 8px corners, hairline header `8px 8px 8px 13px`, 13px body; `foot` for long bodies; `top` dialogs hang at 12vh (the session editor).
- **Palette**: 610px wide, 12vh from the top, at most 1/φ of the window tall; empty, it lists open tabs, then saved sessions, then actions.
- **Lock screen**: an opaque window over everything, fading in 0.16s; a 377px column with a 34px gold lock icon, password or PIN with Unlock, then passkey and Windows Hello, then "Your sessions keep running." in `weak`.
- **Kind glyph**: a 21px tile, 3px corners, the hue on 15% of itself; the session editor's type picker is a row of them.
- **Broadcast outline**: a 2px inset outline in the user's colour and style (steady, breathe, fade, ring, march, rainbow, off); the focus ring turns dashed in `fg` and steps 2px out.
- **Quota bar**: a 3px track in `line`, gold fill, `warn` when nearly full, `error` when full (not a native `progress`).
- **Session icons**: Boxicons 16–18px; only session and folder icons animate (blink, flow, spin, bob), on hover of their row or tab, never under reduced motion.
